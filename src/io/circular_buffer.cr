# A Circular Buffer IO object.
#
# Allocates a memory buffer of a fixed capacity that will never be reallocated.
# Two position pointers to the buffer are maintained: the current write and read
# positions. These positions will overflow back to the beginning when the buffer
# capacity is reached, creating the illusion of a circular buffer structure.
#
# Example:
# ```
# io = IO::CircularBuffer.new(32)
#
# io.write(UInt8.slice(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
# p io.size # => 5
#
# io.close(IO::CircularBuffer::Closed::Write)
# p io.closed?(IO::CircularBuffer::Closed::Write) # => true
# p io.closed?(IO::CircularBuffer::Closed::Read)  # => false
#
# bytes = Bytes.new(32)
# io.read(bytes) # => 5
# p io.size      # => 0
# p bytes        # => Slice[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#
# io.read(bytes) # => 0
# ```
#
# The circular buffer memory IO is `Fiber` aware. The `#read` and `#write` calls
# will block the current fiber when nothing can be read (empty buffer) or when
# nothing can be written (full buffer).
#
# The following example will write 16 bytes then block until at least 8 bytes
# are read from it:
# ```
# io = IO::CircularBuffer.new(16)
# io.write(Bytes.new(24))
# ```
#
# This will block until at least 1 byte is written:
# ```
# io = IO::CircularBuffer.new(16)
# io.read(Bytes.new(8))
# ```
