# HTTP

A pure Crystal (but incomplete) implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol.

Requires OpenSSL 1.1 or above to support ALPN protocol negotiation, which is
required for HTTP/2 over secure connections.

## TODO

- [x] HPACK (including DH compression)
- [x] HTTP/2 connection, streams, frames, ...
- [x] HTTP/2 flow control (in/out, whole-connection, per-stream)
- [ ] HTTP/2 priority
- [x] support HTTP/2 server connections
- [x] ~~integrate transparently into `HTTP::Server`~~ (broken)
- [ ] ~~integrate into `HTTP::Server::Context` (http version, server-push)~~
- [x] support HTTP/2 client connections
- [ ] ~~integrate into `HTTP::Client`~~

- [x] HPACK tests (HTTP/2 protocol, ...)
- [ ] HTTP/2 server unit tests (HTTP/2 protocol, ...)
- [ ] HTTP/2 client unit tests (HTTP/2 protocol, ...)
- [x] h2spec

## Tests

Build and run the `bin/server` server, then launch
[h2spec](https://github.com/summerwind/h2spec/releases).

```sh
$ make bin/server CRFLAGS=-Dh2spec
```

Test against HTTP:
```
$ bin/server
$ ./h2spec -p 9292 -S
```

Test against HTTPS:
```sh
$ TLS=true bin/server
$ ./h2spec -p 9292 -k -t -S
```
